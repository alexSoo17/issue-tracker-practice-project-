# Issue Tracker

This project, named "Issue Tracker," is a practical implementation inspired by Code with Mosh's Next.js course. It serves as a learning exercise for Next.js, a React framework, and incorporates several technologies such as Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Zod, Prisma, and MySQL.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building web applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework.
- [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/): A set of low-level UI primitives for building design systems.
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod): A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): A modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): An open-source relational database management system.

## Project Overview

The "Issue Tracker" project is designed to apply the concepts learned from the Next.js course by Code with Mosh. It focuses on building a practical issue tracking system while utilizing various modern technologies to enhance the development experience.

Please note that this repository is primarily intended for educational purposes and serves as a personal code practice for mastering Next.js. Contributions and suggestions are welcome, but keep in mind that the main goal is to refine Next.js skills.
